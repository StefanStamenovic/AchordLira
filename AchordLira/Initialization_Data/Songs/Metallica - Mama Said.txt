Dm Dsus4 Dm C Am Asus4


Dm            Dsus4     Dm
Mama, she has taught me well
C                  Am Asus2
Told me when I was young
Dm                  Dsus4 Dm
Son, your life's an open book
      C                   Am Asus4
Don't close it 'fore it's done
    Dm                    Dsus4 Dm
The brightest flame burns quickest
   C                Am Asus2
Is what I heard her say
  Dm          Dsus4    Dm
A son's heart sewed to mother
    C              Am
But I must find my way


Dm  C  Am    G
Let my heart go
Dm  C    Am  G
Let your son grow
      Dm  C  Am    G
Mama, let my heart go
   Dm  C    Bb    G  Am Asus2
Or let this heart be still


Dm             Dsus4 Dm
Rebel my new last name
C                Am Asus2
Wild blood in my veins
Dm             Dsus4    D
Apron strings around my neck
    C                 Am Asus4
The mark that still remains
Dm              Dsus4 Dm
Left home at an early age
   C                Am Asus4
Of what I heard was wrong
  Dm             Dsus4 D
I never asked forgiveness
    C               Am
But what is said is done


Dm  C  Am    G
Let my heart go
Dm  C    Am  G
Let your son grow
      Dm  C  Am    G
Mama, let my heart go
   Dm  C    Bb    G  Am Asus4
Or let this heart be still


Dm      G
Never I ask of you
    C       F
But never I gave
        Dm           G
But you gave me your emptiness
      C          F
I now take to my grave
Dm      G
Never I ask of you
    C       F
But never I gave
        Dm           G
But you gave me your emptiness
       C          F
I now take to my grave
   Dm  C    Bb    G  Am Asus2
So let this heart be still


Dm            Dsus4  Dm
Mama, now I'm coming home
        C                 Am Asus2
I'm not all you wished of me
  Dm                Dsus4 Dm
A mother's love for her son
C               Am Asus2
Spoken, help me be
        Dm                 Dsus4 Dm
Well, I took your love for granted
            C                  Am Asus4
And all the things you said to me
  Dm                Dsus4   Dm
I need your arms to welcome me
       C                  Am
But, a cold stone's all I see


Dm  C  Am    G
Let my heart go
Dm  C    Am  G
Let your son grow
      Dm  C  Am    G
Mama, let my heart go
   Dm  C    Bb    G  Am Asus4
Or let this heart be still


Dm  C  Am    G
Let my heart go
      Dm  C  Am    G
Mama, let my heart go
          Dm  C  Am    G
You never let my heart go
   Dm  C    Bb    G  Am
So let this heart be still


Dm      G
Never I ask of you
    C       F
But never I gave
        Dm           G
But you gave me your emptiness
      C          F
I now take to my grave
Dm      G
Never I ask of you
    C       F
But never I gave
        Dm           G
But you gave me your emptiness
       C          F
I now take to my grave
   Dm  C    Bb    G  Am
So let this heart be still
