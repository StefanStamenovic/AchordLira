Gm                             Eb     Cm
Have you got colour in your cheeks? 
Cm                            Gm
Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the tide 
That sticks around like something in your teeth 
          Eb             Cm
And some aces up your sleeve 
                              Gm
Have you no idea that you're in deep 
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week 

           Eb               Cm
How many secrets can you keep?
                                      Gm 
Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow 
                    
When I play it on repeat 
Eb        Cm
Until I fall asleep 
                        D
Spilling drinks on my settee 


          Eb
( Do I wanna Know ) 
          Cm
If this feeling floats both ways 
          Gm
( Sad to see you go ) 
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
          Eb 
( Baby we both know ) 
          Cm
That the nights were mainly made 
           Gm
for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day 


                  Gm
Crawling back to you 
                     Eb  Cm
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
               Gm
Cause I always do
                              Eb       Cm
Well baby I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
                     Gm
Now I've thought it through
                  Gm
Crawling back to you
