Drinking Song
Ortodox Celts
Jonca

    Em
The clock started noon,
  Em
I jumped out of bed,
  G
I drank a cup of coffee
      G
And I walked out to the street.
         Em
It was a boring sunny day,
      Em
I was lookin' for some fun,
  H
I tried to find someone
     Em
So I walked into a pub.

          Em
There was Lucky playin' banjo,
     Em
On accordion was Jake,
   G
We drank some beer and whiskey
    G
And pint of good old Celtic gin.
       Em
It was derby on TV,
   Em
On Parkhead was a crowd,
   C                D
We started watchin' game
     G
With hope that our Celts would win.

G
We are drinkin' beer,
C               G
We are drinkin' gin,
   C                G
No matter what's in bottle
       D             G
We are drinkin' everything.

Then we took a short walk through the dirty streets,
And came back to the pub, for the game of darts,
Celtic beat the rangers, all the people sang & cheered,
We broke some bloody glasses, we were little bit of weird

That was ordinarily day in our smelly town,
We felt the smell of petrol and the dust between the toes,
Our eyes were chilly sparkled like a jewels in the crown,
Our hearts are always fill, doesn't matter where we go.
